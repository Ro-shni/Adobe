# Approach Explanation: Persona-Driven Document Intelligence

## Methodology Overview

This solution implements an intelligent document analysis system that adapts to different user personas and their specific job requirements. The approach combines advanced natural language processing techniques with domain-specific knowledge to extract and rank relevant content from document collections.

## Core Methodology

### 1. Persona Recognition System

The solution employs a sophisticated pattern-matching algorithm to identify user personas from role descriptions and job requirements. This involves:

**Keyword-Based Classification**: 
- Pre-defined vocabulary sets for each persona type (Travel Planner, HR Professional, Food Contractor, etc.)
- Semantic analysis of role descriptions and job tasks
- Context-aware keyword matching that considers both explicit mentions and implicit relationships

**Pattern Recognition**:
- Analysis of job descriptions for task-specific terminology
- Identification of domain-specific language patterns
- Fallback classification based on job requirements when persona is ambiguous

### 2. Content Relevance Scoring

The system uses a multi-dimensional scoring algorithm to evaluate content relevance:

**Keyword Matching (40% weight)**:
- Persona-specific vocabulary analysis
- Frequency-based keyword scoring
- Semantic similarity calculations using TF-IDF vectorization

**Job Alignment (30% weight)**:
- Task-specific content identification
- Goal-oriented relevance assessment
- Context matching between job requirements and content

**Content Quality (20% weight)**:
- Text length optimization (preferring medium-length sections)
- Structural importance indicators (headings, lists, bullet points)
- Readability and coherence assessment

**Context Relevance (10% weight)**:
- Semantic relationship to user goals
- Domain-specific relevance factors
- Cross-document content relationships

### 3. Document Processing Pipeline

The solution implements a robust multi-stage processing pipeline:

**Stage 1: Text Extraction**
- Dual-engine approach using pdfplumber (primary) and PyPDF2 (fallback)
- Page-aware text extraction with position tracking
- Noise filtering and artifact removal

**Stage 2: Section Segmentation**
- Intelligent content chunking based on natural breaks
- Paragraph-level segmentation with context preservation
- Hierarchical structure identification

**Stage 3: Relevance Analysis**
- Multi-factor scoring for each text section
- Persona-specific relevance calculation
- Cross-document content correlation

**Stage 4: Ranking & Selection**
- Top-N relevant section extraction
- Importance ranking based on composite scores
- Diversity optimization to avoid redundant content

**Stage 5: Subsection Analysis**
- Detailed content refinement and cleaning
- Noise removal and text normalization
- Quality filtering for meaningful content

## Technical Implementation

### Natural Language Processing

**Text Preprocessing**:
- Tokenization using NLTK and spaCy
- Stop word removal and stemming
- Part-of-speech tagging for context understanding

**Feature Extraction**:
- TF-IDF vectorization for keyword importance
- N-gram analysis for phrase-level matching
- Semantic similarity calculations

**Content Analysis**:
- Named entity recognition for domain-specific entities
- Sentiment analysis for content tone assessment
- Readability metrics for content quality evaluation

### Machine Learning Components

**Vectorization Strategy**:
- TF-IDF with 1-2 gram features
- Maximum 1000 features to maintain performance
- Minimum document frequency of 2 to filter rare terms

**Similarity Calculations**:
- Cosine similarity for content matching
- Euclidean distance for feature comparison
- Custom weighting for persona-specific features

**Ranking Algorithm**:
- Multi-criteria decision making
- Weighted scoring with configurable parameters
- Threshold-based filtering for quality control
